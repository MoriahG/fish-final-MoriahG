### Description
In an endeavor to be the greatest JavaScripter alive, I have used PixiJS to create a beautiful, flourishing, aquarium with animated fish. My coding strategy mainly consisted of throwing a bunch of random tests at these fish and hoping for the best! There have been many complications resulting in a few aquatic casualties, but the fish tank is undergoing a great recovery thanks to interface interactions. This aquarium is reaching its final form.
